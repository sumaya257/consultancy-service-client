## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first styling.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation and dynamic routing.
- **Axios**: For handling API requests and managing client-server communication.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: For routing and API creation.
- **MongoDB**: For storing and managing application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and securing API endpoints.
- **Cookies**: Used to store JWT securely and manage user sessions.

## Authentication Flow (JWT with Cookies)
1. **User Login**:
   - Users log in by entering their credentials (email and password).
   - The backend validates the credentials and generates a signed JWT token.
   - The token is sent back to the frontend and stored in an HTTP-only cookie.

2. **Accessing Protected Routes**:
   - The cookie containing the JWT is sent with every request to the server.
   - The backend verifies the token and grants access to protected resources or pages.

3. **Logout**:
   - Logging out clears the cookie on the client side, effectively ending the session.

4. **Security Features**:
   - **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Ensures tokens cannot be accessed via JavaScript, reducing XSS risks.
   - **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens are configured with an expiration time to prevent indefinite sessions.
   - **Role-Based Access**: Certain routes or features are restricted based on user roles (if implemented).

## Technologies for JWT and Cookies
- **jsonwebtoken**: To sign and verify JWT tokens.
- **cookie-parser**: For parsing cookies on the server side.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables securely (e.g., secret keys for signing tokens).

---

## API Highlights
- **Authentication Endpoints**:
  - `POST /login`: Authenticates the user and generates a JWT stored in cookies.
  - `GET /protected`: Example of a route accessible only with a valid token.
- **Category-Specific Content**:
  - `GET /categories/:id`: Returns data for a specific category.

## Additional Information
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Integration of advanced role-based authorization (e.g., admin vs. regular users).
  - Adding refresh token functionality for prolonged user sessions.
